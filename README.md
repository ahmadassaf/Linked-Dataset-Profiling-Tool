##Linked Dataset Profiling Tool
=========================

The Linked Dataset Profiling tool is an implementation of the approach proposed in [1]. It's main purpose is generating 
structured profiles of Linked Datasets. A profile in this case representes a graph, consisting of linked datasets, 
resource instances and topics. The topics are DBpedia categories, which are extracted through a Named Entity 
Disambiguation process by analysing textual literals from resources. The main steps which are executed from the 
profiling tool are: 

1. Dataset metadata extraction from DataHub
2. Resource instance extraction 
3. Entity and topic extraction through NED from extracted resources using NED tools like Spotlight or TagMe!
4. Profile graph construction and topic ranking
5. Exporting of profiles in JSON format.

The individual steps are explained in detail in [1], here we provide a brief overview of the output from each step. 
In step (1) the input required from the tool is a dataset id, extracted from DataHub, i.e. lak-dataset 
(http://datahub.io/dataset/lak-dataset) or a group id of datasets, i.e. lodcloud (http://datahub.io/organizations/lodcloud). 
As an output the LDP tool extracts the metadata from the datasets, such as the SPARQL endpoint, name, maintainer etc., 
and stores in a directory given by the user. In step (2) LDP extracts resource instances from the given datasets in (1).
 It has the option to sample the extracted resources, based on three sampling strategies: random, weighted and centrality 
 (see [1]). Furthermore, the user can define what percentage of resources he/she wants to extract, i.e. 5,10,...,95% 
 of resources. In step (3) from the extracted resources, the tool performs the NED process by analysing the textual 
 literals of resources. Here, one can define what datatype properties are of interest for the NED process, which can 
 be fed in into the tool during the process. In this step, LDP extracts de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities as 
 DBpedia de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities, and the topics from the extracted de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities through the 
 datatype property dcterms:subject. The last step of the LDP tool, is step (4) where from the extracted datasets 
 and their corresponding sampled resources, and the extracted de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities and topics in step (3), 
 we build the dataset topic graph as our profile. The topics are ranked for their relevance to the respective 
 datasets by different graphical models that can be fed into the LDP tool by the user, i.e. prank, kstep, hits, 
 for PageRank with Priors, K-Step Markov and HITS, respecitvely. Finally, after ranking the topics for their 
 relevance, the LDP tool can export the profiles into JSON format, such that they can be further analysed or exported 
 into RDF or other formats. For RDF we provide the tool which exposes the profiles into RDF using the VoID and VoL schema.


In order to run the LDP tool, it requires few variables to be added in its config file. We show here the possible input values for the different variables (where with "|" we show all acceptable and recognisable values by the tool), wheres for others we provide a simple textual description. See below for the sample config file. The defined variables and values should be stored in a separate file and should be given as an inline argument to the LDP tool, e.g. java -jar ldp.jar config.ini

###Example config values
=========================

Only one value at at time, 0 - is for step (1), 1 for step (2), and so on

```
loadcase=0|1|2|3|4
```


An existing directory where the extracted datasets and resources will be stored

```
datasetpath=directory location
```


Path and the name of the file which will hold the computed values for the normalised topic relevance score computed as in (1)

```
normalised_topic_score=file location
```


Path and the name of the file which will hold the extracted de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities and topics from DBpedia

```
annotationindex=file location
```


Sample size, which defines the ratio of extracted resources for a dataset. Be aware here that Step (3) for large sample sizes takes a long time, and as shown in [1] a sample size of 10% is representative

```
sample_size=1|2|...|95
```


Sampling strategy to extract the resources, 'centrality' performs best in terms of profiling accuracy

```
sampling_type=random|weighted|centrality
```


Path to an existing directory for the output directory location

```
outdir=directory location
```


Path to an existing directory for the output generated by the different topic ranking approaches

```
topic_ranking_objects=directory location
```


Dataset id or group id from datahub for which you want to perform the profiling

```
query_str=datahub_dataset_id|datahub_group_id
```


In case you are looking for a dataset id, then the value here should be false, and vice versa

```
is_dataset_group_search=true|false
```


Topic ranking approaches in Step (4), which determines the relevance of topics for a dataset

```
topic_ranking_strategies=prank|kstep|hits
```


Path to a file containing datatype properties of interest for the NED process. Here the datatype properties should be one per line and their object values should be textual literals

```
property_lookup=file location of properties of interest which need to be considered for NED analysis
```
 

Location where to store the generated dataset topic graphs

```
raw_graph_dir=directory location 
```


Define which NED process to use. Spotlight doesn't require any changes, while for TagMe! one needs to get the API credenitals (contact at http://tagme.di.unipi.it/) and provide it under the tagme_api_key

```
ned_operation=tagme|spotlight 
```


DBpedia sparql endpoints in different languages

```
dbpedia_endpoint=en	http://dbpedia.org/sparql,de	http://de.dbpedia.org/live/sparql 
```


This has to be set to true as it checks for the extracted de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities whether their corresponding topics (categories) are extracted

```
load_entity_categories=true 
```


URL for the english DBpedia used for the extraction of entity categories

```
dbpedia_url=http://dbpedia.org/sparql 
```


Timeout (in seconds) when extracting resources from the data sets

```
timeout=10000 
```


Define whether the de.l3s.bfetahu.ldp.entities should be included in the profiles or should be left out of the ranking process

```
includeEntities=false 
```


File location where the dataset_topic_graph is stored

```
dataset_topic_graph=raw_graph/dataset_topic_graph.obj
```


Values used to initialise the KStep and PageRank models

```
alpha=0.1
```


K value for K-Step Markov

```
k_steps=3 
```


Number of iterations used for the ranking of topics with K-Step Markov and PageRank with Priors

```
ranking_iterations=10
```
